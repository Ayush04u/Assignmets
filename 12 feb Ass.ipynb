    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the program stops running and an error message is displayed, indicating the type of exception and where it occurred in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors: These occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the code, such as a missing parenthesis or a typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors: These occur when the code is syntactically correct, but an error occurs during the execution of the program. Examples include division by zero, attempting to access an element in a list that does not exist, or trying to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical errors: These occur when the code runs without error, but does not produce the expected output. These errors are more difficult to detect and can be caused by incorrect algorithms or incorrect assumptions about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before the code is executed, while exceptions occur during the execution of the program. Syntax errors are typically caused by mistakes in the code, while exceptions are typically caused by unexpected events during the execution of the program. Additionally, syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, while exceptions can be caught and handled within the code to allow the program to continue running."
