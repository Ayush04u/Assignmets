    "The close() function is used to close a file object that was previously opened using the open() function. It is important to close a file because leaving a file open can have unintended consequences, such as preventing other programs from accessing the file, using up system resources, or causing data corruption.\n",

It is considered good practice to always close files after they are opened, even if the program terminates shortly afterward.
